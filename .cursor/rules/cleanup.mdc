description: Run `cleanup.py` script before and after changes
globs: 
---
Before you do any changes or if I say "cleanup", run the `cleanup.py update` script in the main folder. Analyze the results, describe recent changes in @LOG.md and edit @TODO.md to update priorities and plan next changes. PERFORM THE CHANGES, then run the `cleanup.py status` script and react to the results.

When you edit @TODO.md, lead in lines with empty GFM checkboxes if things aren't done (`- [ ] `) vs. filled (`- [x] `) if done.
