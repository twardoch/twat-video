- **Verify Information**: Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.
- **No Apologies**: Never use apologies.
- **No Whitespace Suggestions**: Don't suggest whitespace changes.
- **No Inventions**: Don't invent major changes other than what's explicitly requested.
- **No Unnecessary Confirmations**: Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.
- **Preserve Existing Code**: Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.
- **No Implementation Checks**: Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.
- **No Unnecessary Updates**: Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.
- **No Current Implementation**: Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.
- **Use Explicit Variable Names**: Prefer descriptive, explicit variable names over short, ambiguous ones to enhance code readability.
- **Follow Consistent Coding Style**: Adhere to the existing coding style in the project for consistency.
- **Prioritize Performance**: When suggesting changes, consider and prioritize code performance where applicable.
- **Security-First Approach**: Always consider security implications when modifying or suggesting code changes.
- **Test Coverage**: Suggest or include appropriate unit tests for new or modified code.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging where necessary.
- **Modular Design**: Encourage modular design principles to improve code maintainability and reusability.
- **Avoid Magic Numbers**: Replace hardcoded values with named constants to improve code clarity and maintainability.
- **Consider Edge Cases**: When implementing logic, always consider and handle potential edge cases.
- **Use Assertions**: Include assertions wherever possible to validate assumptions and catch potential errors early.
