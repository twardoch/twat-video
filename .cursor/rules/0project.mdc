# About this project

`twat-fs` is a file system utility library focused on robust and extensible file upload capabilities with multiple provider support. It provides:

- Multi-provider upload system with smart fallback (catbox.moe default, plus Dropbox, S3, etc.)
- Automatic retry for temporary failures, fallback for permanent ones
- URL validation and clean developer experience with type hints
- Simple CLI: `python -m twat_fs upload_file path/to/file.txt`
- Easy installation: `uv pip install twat-fs` (basic) or `uv pip install 'twat-fs[all,dev]'` (all features)

## Development Notes
- Uses `uv` for Python package management
- Quality tools: ruff, mypy, pytest
- Clear provider protocol for adding new storage backends
- Strong typing and runtime checks throughout
